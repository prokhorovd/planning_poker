### Description
Game provided with 10-card deck. 8 of them are 'fibonacci' number-cards that can be used to estimation purposes and 2 of them are utility-type cards: 'question' ( picked if user have questions) and 'coffee' (picked if user want to take a break).

Game session length set to 10 second for testing purposes and can be changed in START_TIME constant (./client/src/components/Timer/Timer.tsx).

Every user should pick an emoji-avatar and name to start.

User can:
- create room
- join existing room using room id
- vote after game was started by room-admin

When user create a room he's becoming an admin of this room.

Admin can:
